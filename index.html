    <div class="description">I plan to stick with this endeavor, learning
        and improving as much as possible in order to build something amazing.
        There will be many moments where I feel like giving up, because it's 
        too daunting, or it's too late, or it's never going to work out. I 
        need to silence those doubts and persevere. Because that is the only 
        way.
